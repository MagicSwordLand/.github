# MagicSwordLand

This organization houses all the custom plugin source code for MagicSwordLand (MSLand). Since we decided to close the server two years ago, I thought it would be beneficial to make the source codes public for documentation purposes. Most of these plugins were written by me single-handedly and currently lack documentation or comments. I hope to revisit and rewrite them with proper documentation in the future.
