# MagicSwordLand

This organization houses all the custom plugin source code for MagicSwordLand (MSLand). Since we decided to close the server two years ago, I thought it would be beneficial to make the source code public for documentation purposes. Most of these plugins were written by me single-handedly and currently lack documentation or comments. I hope to revisit and rewrite them with proper documentation in the future.

Though without comments and documents, it's all well written, organized and self-documenting code, with correct knowledge of how a spigot plugin works and what the plugin does, any experienced java developer should be able to understand most of the codes.
